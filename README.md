# UniersitySwiftProject
The full list of repositories containing every app written in Swift with XCode for different university projects.
Each of this project introduced us with a concept of app making with XCode like <u>the use of json to save</u> with **MyAnniversaires**, <u>CoreData</u> with **Bibliothèque**, using <u>maps</u> and <u>coordinate</u> with **MuseesParisiensGeoLoc**, etc.

Here is the list of each projects with what they do and what they introduce. Each project has been sorted chronologicaly:

This is mainly to wrap-up this whole course by making us use maps, coredata and a lot of things we used.|

## Why each project has been compiled into one repo?
Before, each project was in there respective repo. But I won't update them and work on them anymore as we have advanced in the course and won't be updating / using our old apps. To clean up a little bit my GitHub, I've decided to make on big repo with every project in it. When this course will be over, I will archive this repo and never touch it again.
