| REF (RestezEnBonneForme) (Stay in good shape) 	| A more "*complex*" app, containing two views. One to input data, the other to display the result. <br>The user enters his weight and height on the first page. He then gets redirected to the second page displaying his BMI with a little descriptive text about what the result means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|
| CoffreFort (Safe)                             	| This app is a "*password manager*", where the user can enter the name of a website and his password for it. Of course, we could have learn to encrypt data, but this wasn't the goal of this application. It was meant <br>	as an introduction to table views and data manipulation / file creation (Sandbox). We saved the data inside .JSON file which were then being loaded on the app launch. Password are just text string, not being hash or even hidden in app.                                                                                                                                                                   	|
| Bliblioth√®que (Library)                       	| In this app the user enters the name of the person, with the title of a book and a date. It is meant to track all the books the user has given (to whom he landed the book, when, which book). This app was just a big exercise to use what we had learn so far. It uses all the concepts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
| MesAnniversaires (My anniversary)             	| This app is an introduction to DataCore. It was pretty much the same app as above. The user enters a name and date of birthday, the app then saves this data and display it inside a table view. The big change here is the use of data manipulation with DataCore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	|
| MuseesParisiens (Parisian museums)            	| This app introduced the use of Plans and annotations using the CoreLocation framework. We had three museums stored in hard. The goal was to display this three museum on a map with annotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	|
| RecettesDuMonde (Recipes from the world)      	| This is the big final project to this course. We just had a use case diagram and had to design the app and create it. We had to use pretty much everything from above. The main functionalities being the usage of DataCore and CoreLocation. <br>In this app, you have a list of recipes from all around the world. You can see on the map annotations for each recipe. There is also a table view listing every recipe. When the user clicks on a recipe he is taken to a third view with a short description, the country of origin, a list of ingredient to make this recipe and a button to view the country of origin on the plan. 	|
