#University Swift Project

This repository contains a list of Swift projects made for my college course : "Programmation Mobile IOT" (Mobile development for IOT). This projects were made on XCode.
Each project was made to introduce a new concept / iOS function like table views, plan with MapKit, databases using DataCore, etc.

You can find all the projects in the main branch or you can download each project independently by cloning the branch of the project. 
I've decided to regroup all projects into one Git Hub repo to avoid creating a thousands different repository and as this repository will be archive at the end of the semester (December of 2021). Also, as these projects aren't really complex and are just introduction to new concepts, I don't want to create repositories for each and every project. And I won't work on these again, I've just uploaded them as portfolio content and memories.

Here is a list of all projects with  a description. They are ordered chronologically:
| Cliqueur (Clicker)                            	| This app is the first app we did. It is a clicker as the name suggest and only contains one view and was meant to introduce development on Apple. This app is made of a button which increment a variable, which itself is displayed by a label.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
|-----------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| REF (RestezEnBonneForme) (Stay in good shape) 	| A more "*complex*" app, containing two views. One to input data, the other to display the result. <br>The user enters his weight and height on the first page. He then gets redirected to the second page displaying his BMI with a little descriptive text about what the result means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|
| CoffreFort (Safe)                             	| This app is a "*password manager*", where the user can enter the name of a website and his password for it. Of course, we could have learn to encrypt data, but this wasn't the goal of this application. It was meant <br>	as an introduction to table views and data manipulation / file creation (Sandbox). We saved the data inside .JSON file which were then being loaded on the app launch. Password are just text string, not being hash or even hidden in app.                                                                                                                                                                   	|
| Bliblioth√®que (Library)                       	| In this app the user enters the name of the person, with the title of a book and a date. It is meant to track all the books the user has given (to whom he landed the book, when, which book). This app was just a big exercise to use what we had learn so far. It uses all the concepts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
| MesAnniversaires (My anniversary)             	| This app is an introduction to DataCore. It was pretty much the same app as above. The user enters a name and date of birthday, the app then saves this data and display it inside a table view. The big change here is the use of data manipulation with DataCore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	|
| MuseesParisiens (Parisian museums)            	| This app introduced the use of Plans and annotations using the CoreLocation framework. We had three museums stored in hard. The goal was to display this three museum on a map with annotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	|
| RecettesDuMonde (Recipes from the world)      	| This is the big final project to this course. We just had a use case diagram and had to design the app and create it. We had to use pretty much everything from above. The main functionalities being the usage of DataCore and CoreLocation. <br>In this app, you have a list of recipes from all around the world. You can see on the map annotations for each recipe. There is also a table view listing every recipe. When the user clicks on a recipe he is taken to a third view with a short description, the country of origin, a list of ingredient to make this recipe and a button to view the country of origin on the plan. 	|


<br/>

As you can see, these projects aren't complex. They were simple to make sure we could understand each concept and have the time to experiment with them. One semester is pretty short and we had a lot to learn. Practically each week was a new project. 
As said in the introduction of this README, I will archive this project at the end of the semester when RecettesDuMonde is finished. I invite you to take a look at the final project down below if you are interested in what we've done here.

## Other project - Stud'Help

We had another and last final project to make to conclude this course. You can find it here: https://github.com/Ttiki/StudeHelp 
We had to come up with an idea, draw each diagrams (class, use case, sequence, etc.) design the wireframe and mock-up views of our app, and then develop it.
